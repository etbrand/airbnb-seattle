# airbnb-seattle

This repo is an analysis of Airbnb property prices in Seattle. Data are from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/), a provider of scraped and cleaned Airbnb data from cities around the world. The **EDA** notebook is an exploration of the data, and the **Preprocessing_and_modeling** notebook constructs features and fits an XGBoost model of property prices, making use of textual descriptions of the properties provided by their hosts.
